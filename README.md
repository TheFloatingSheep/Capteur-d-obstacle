This is a first project for an obstacle sensor used in a motorised gate. Maybe it will help someone. The components used in this project are as follows:

- Arduino Uno R3
- Ultrasonic distance sensor (4 pins)
- Piezoelectric buzzer
- 16x2 LCD screen
- 1kΩ resistor
- 220 Ω resistor (x2)
- Green LED
- Red LED

It is also possible to find the electrical diagram for this project if required.
